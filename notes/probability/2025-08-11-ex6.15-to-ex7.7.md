## Content Logic

### 1. Exercise 6.15–6.17: Independence and sequence transformations
- Defined L_n as the length of a run of zeros starting at position n.
- Showed that the event {L_n ≥ r_n infinitely often} has probability 0 or 1 depending on convergence or divergence of Σ p^(r_n).
- Used independence of X_2, X_3, … as a probabilistic replica of X_1, X_2, … to establish equal probabilities for shifted events.
- Constructed A'_{a,n} by replacing S_n = X_1 + … + X_n with S'_n = X_2 + … + X_{n+1} and showed P(A_{a,n}) = P(A'_{a,n}).

### 2. Gambler's ruin setup
- Let s_c(a) be the probability of reaching capital c before 0 starting from a.
- Derived the recurrence s_c(a) = p s_c(a+1) + q s_c(a-1), 0 < a < c, by conditioning on the first play’s result.
- Explained that X_2, X_3, … having the same distribution as X_1, X_2, … allows the recurrence to hold for all interior states.

### 3. Solving the difference equation
- For p ≠ q, general solution s_c(a) = A + B ρ^a with ρ = q/p.
- For p = q, solution s_c(a) = A + B a.
- Applied boundary conditions s_c(0) = 0, s_c(c) = 1 to determine constants:
  - p ≠ q: s_c(a) = (ρ^a − 1) / (ρ^c − 1)
  - p = q = 1/2: s_c(a) = a / c
- Clarified that the form A + B ρ^a arises because the ratio s_c(a) / s_c(a+1) is constant in the homogeneous equation.

### 4. Stopping times and boundedness
- Defined F_n as the capital at step n without stopping, and F_n* as the capital with stopping time τ, remaining constant after τ.
- Uniform boundedness means there is a fixed constant M such that 0 ≤ F_n* ≤ M for all n, ensuring applicability of martingale convergence theorems (e.g., Theorem 5.4).

### 5. Example 7.7: Role of infinite capital
- Demonstrated how infinite capital removes the upper bound on F_n*, violating uniform boundedness.
- Showed that without boundedness, Theorem 5.4’s conclusions (such as expectation preservation) can fail.
- Illustrated that infinite capital can allow strategies that dramatically increase the probability of success, altering the qualitative outcome compared to the finite capital case.

## Key Ideas
- Shift invariance in i.i.d. sequences justifies recurrences in hitting probability problems.
- Linear homogeneous difference equations with constant coefficients yield exponential or linear solutions depending on p ≠ q or p = q.
- Stopping time analysis requires boundedness to control limiting behavior.
- Infinite resources fundamentally change the gambling model’s conclusions.

## Questions & Confusions
- Still unclear on the intuitive reason why the ratio s_c(a) / s_c(a+1) must be constant from the recurrence alone; this needs more concrete examples.

## Reflections
- The gambler’s ruin model provides a clear bridge between probability theory, difference equations, and martingale theory.
- The boundedness requirement is not merely technical; it prevents unrealistic strategies from breaking the model’s conclusions.
- Example 7.7 is a good case study of how relaxing assumptions can undermine previously proven results.
