## Key Ideas

- Define `d_i(ω)` as the binary digit of ω in [0,1]. Then `r_i(ω) = 2d_i(ω) - 1` ∈ {–1, +1} becomes the Rademacher function.
- Let `s_n(ω) = ∑_{i=1}^n r_i(ω)`. This represents a random walk or gain/loss in `n` coin tosses.
- The key identity:  
  `∑ d_i(ω) = (s_n(ω) + n)/2`  
  ⇒ the weak law becomes equivalent to bounding the deviation of `s_n(ω)/n` from 0.
- The variance `∫ s_n^2(ω) dω = n` comes from pairwise orthogonality:
  - `∫ r_i(ω) r_j(ω) dω = 0` for i ≠ j
  - `∫ r_i^2(ω) dω = 1`
- Apply Chebyshev’s inequality:
  - `P(|s_n| ≥ nε) ≤ (1/nε²) ∫ s_n²(ω) dω = 1/(nε²)`
- Equivalently shows that the probability of large deviation vanishes as `n → ∞`.

## Reflections

- This approach reframes WLLN in terms of integration on [0,1] instead of expectation on abstract probability spaces.
- Key insight: orthogonality of Rademacher functions = independence.
- Chebyshev’s inequality is derived geometrically via shaded-area lemma:
  - `P(f ≥ α) ≤ (1/α) ∫ f dω`
