## Key Ideas

* In probability theory, we want to assign probabilities not just to simple events like finite unions of intervals, but to more complex sets such as the set of normal numbers or gambler ruin events.
* A finite union of intervals is insufficient to capture many probabilistically meaningful sets.
* This motivates defining structured families of subsets of Ω = (0,1] that are closed under key operations.

## Field and σ-field Definitions

* A **field** 𝓕 of subsets of Ω is a class such that:

  * Ω ∈ 𝓕
  * If A ∈ 𝓕, then Aᶜ ∈ 𝓕
  * If A, B ∈ 𝓕, then A ∪ B ∈ 𝓕

* A **σ-field** is a field that is additionally closed under **countable unions**:

  * If A₁, A₂, ... ∈ 𝓕, then ⋃ Aₙ ∈ 𝓕

* These definitions imply closure under finite intersections and countable intersections (via DeMorgan’s law).

## Examples and Non-Examples

* **Example 2.2**: Finite disjoint unions of intervals in (0,1] form a field 𝓑₀, but not a σ-field. It does not contain singletons {x} or countable unions like the set of normal numbers N.
* **Example 2.3**: The collection of all finite or cofinite sets forms a field. If Ω is infinite, this field is not a σ-field.
* **Example 2.4**: The countable and cocountable sets form a σ-field, but still fail to include certain uncountable unions (e.g., unions of singletons forming a non-measurable set).

These show that even a σ-field may not include all subsets of Ω, emphasizing the need to generate specific σ-fields from desired sets.

## The σ-field Generated by a Class

* Given a class 𝒜 of subsets of Ω, we define the smallest σ-field containing 𝒜, denoted σ(𝒜), as the intersection of all σ-fields that contain 𝒜.
* This construction ensures:

  1. 𝒜 ⊆ σ(𝒜)
  2. σ(𝒜) is a σ-field
  3. If 𝒜 ⊆ ℐ and ℐ is a σ-field, then σ(𝒜) ⊆ ℐ

## The Borel σ-field

* **Example 2.6**: Let 𝒥 be the class of subintervals of (0,1]. The σ-field σ(𝒥), called 𝓑, is the **Borel σ-field**.
* 𝓑 contains all open sets, countable unions and intersections of intervals, and sets like the normal numbers.
* 𝓑 is sufficient for most applications in analysis and probability, but still does not contain *all* subsets of (0,1] (see p. 45).

---

## Reflections

* The step from field to σ-field is not just a formality; it is essential for capturing infinite behaviors that naturally arise in probability.
* σ(𝒜) allows us to flexibly start from simple generators (like intervals or singletons) and expand to a rich collection of measurable sets.
* Borel sets serve as the practical domain for defining probability measures over real numbers, while avoiding pathological non-measurable cases.
