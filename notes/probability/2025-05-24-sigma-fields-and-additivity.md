> **Note**:
> Today’s focus is on the structure and generation of sigma-fields, and the behavior of finitely versus countably additive set functions. We examined conditions under which the σ-field generated by a class A coincides with classes closed under countable unions and intersections, and explored how specific constructions on fields demonstrate failures of countable additivity.

---

## Content Logic

We moved from structural questions about σ-fields and separability (Problems 2.8–2.12) into functional behavior (Problems 2.13–2.15), focusing on when a set function can be countably additive. A key theme is that without closure under countable unions, functions defined even with natural logic (like indicator containment or local neighborhood coverage) can fail countable additivity. These ideas form the conceptual basis for why probability measures must be defined on σ-fields.

## Key Ideas

* σ(A) is the smallest σ-field over A, and in certain settings (e.g., when complements can be written as countable unions), it coincides with the smallest class closed under countable unions and intersections.
* Any element in σ(A) depends only on a countable subcollection of A.
* Separability of σ-fields depends on the cardinality of the base set Ω.
* Finitely additive functions on fields need not be countably additive; such behavior is ruled out on σ-fields.

## Problem 2.8 Summary

If A is such that the complement of every A ∈ A is a countable union of elements of A (e.g., intervals in (0,1)), then σ(A) equals the smallest class over A closed under countable unions and intersections.

---

## Problem 2.9 Summary

Any B ∈ σ(A) depends only on a **countable subclass** A\_B ⊆ A. This illustrates the separable nature of σ-fields even when A is uncountable.

---

## Problem 2.10 Summary

(a) If σ(A) contains all subsets of Ω, then for any distinct ω, ω′ ∈ Ω, there exists A ∈ A such that their indicators differ.

(b) If Ω is countable, the converse holds.

(c) If Ω is uncountable, the converse fails—example required.

---

## Problem 2.11 Summary

(a) The Borel σ-field is countably generated.

(b) The σ-field in Example 2.4 is countably generated iff Ω is countable.

(c) A sub-σ-field of a countably generated σ-field may not be countably generated. This is a nontrivial result and a counterexample is required.

---

## Problem 2.12 Summary

A σ-field cannot be countably infinite—it must be either finite or have the cardinality of the continuum. However, a **field** can be countably infinite (example required).

---

## Problem 2.13 Summary

Constructed a function P on the field of finite/cofinite sets:

* (a) P is finitely additive.
* (b) P is **not** countably additive if Ω is countably infinite.
* (c) P **is** countably additive if Ω is uncountable.
* (d) Similar construction with countable/cocountable sets shows that countable additivity can hold when the structure prohibits more than one cocountable disjoint component.

---

## Problem 2.14 Summary

Let F = {A : A is first category or A^c is first category}. F is a σ-field. Define P(A) = 0 if A is first category, 1 otherwise. P is countably additive since the union of first category sets is still first category.

---

## Problem 2.15 Summary

P(A) = 1 if A contains a right neighborhood of 1/2, 0 otherwise, defined on a field in (0,1):

* P is finitely additive,
* but not countably additive (construct disjoint intervals approaching 1/2 from the right),
* such a function cannot exist on σ-fields like C₀ in S^∞ due to structural closure (Theorem 2.3).

---

## Reflections

These problems deepen intuition on when σ-structure is necessary. Countable additivity is not just a convenient axiom; it is essential for functions to behave well under limits. Fields, which lack closure under countable unions, allow functions to jump at the limit—something inadmissible for probability measures. Defining functions based on local or asymptotic properties can break additivity if structural closure is missing.
