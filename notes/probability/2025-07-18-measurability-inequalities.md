## Problem 5.1 ‚Äì Measurability and œÉ-fields

- (a) Showed that a random variable X is measurable w.r.t. œÉ-field ùí¢ iff œÉ(X) ‚äÜ ùí¢. Used the fact that œÉ(Y) generates minimal œÉ-field under which Y is measurable.
- (b) Proved that when ùí¢ = {‚àÖ, Œ©}, any measurable X must be constant (since only trivial sets are measurable).
- (c) If every A ‚àà ùí¢ has probability 0 or 1, and X is measurable w.r.t. ùí¢, then X is almost surely constant. Examples include tail œÉ-field or œÉ-field of countable-cocountable sets under Lebesgue measure.

## Problem 5.2 ‚Äì Replacing the Unit Interval

- Discussed how in Theorem 5.3 (constructing an i.i.d. sequence with given distributions), the unit interval [0,1] can be replaced by any nonatomic probability space. This generalization leverages the richness of nonatomic spaces to support uniform random variables needed for inverse transform constructions.

## Problem 5.3 ‚Äì Minimizer of Expected Squared Error

- Proved that m = E[X] minimizes E[(X ‚àí m)¬≤].
- Used calculus: minimized function f(m) = E[(X ‚àí m)¬≤] by taking derivative and setting f‚Ä≤(m) = 0.
- Also provided intuitive understanding: variance is minimized when centered at mean.

## Problem 5.4 ‚Äì Sharpness of Chebyshev

- Constructed X taking values m‚àíŒ±, m, m+Œ± with probabilities p, 1‚àí2p, p.
- Showed that this leads to equality in Chebyshev‚Äôs inequality, hence the bound cannot be improved without additional assumptions on X (like symmetry or unimodality).

## Problem 5.5 ‚Äì Cantelli‚Äôs Inequality and Comparison

- (a) Proved Cantelli's inequality:  
  P(X ‚àí m ‚â• Œ±) ‚â§ œÉ¬≤ / (œÉ¬≤ + Œ±¬≤), for Œ± ‚â• 0  
  via minimization over auxiliary parameter Œª in E[(X ‚àí Œª)¬≤].
- (b) Derived two-sided version:  
  P(|X ‚àí m| ‚â• Œ±) ‚â§ 2œÉ¬≤ / (œÉ¬≤ + Œ±¬≤)
- (c) Constructed example with X taking two values to show equality is achieved ‚áí Cantelli's inequality is sharp.

## Problem 5.6 ‚Äì Schwarz via Polynomial Positivity

- Considered function f(t) = E[(t|X| + |Y|)¬≤], a quadratic in t.
- Since it has at most one real root ‚áí discriminant ‚â§ 0 ‚áí  
  (E[|X||Y|])¬≤ ‚â§ E[|X|¬≤] ¬∑ E[|Y|¬≤], which is Schwarz‚Äôs inequality.

## Problem 5.7 ‚Äì Jensen-based Power Inequality

- (a) Rewrote (5.37) as:  
  E^{Œ≤/Œ±} [ |X|^Œ± ] ‚â§ E[ |X|^Œ± ]^{Œ≤/Œ±}  
  and derived this from Jensen's inequality using œÜ(z) = z^{Œ≤/Œ±}, a convex function when Œ≤ ‚â• Œ±.
- (b) Proved that  
  E[1 / X^p] ‚â• 1 / (E[X])^p for p > 0 and X > 0  
  by applying Jensen's inequality with convex œÜ(x) = x^(‚àíp).

## Problem 5.8 ‚Äì Jensen Inequality in Two Variables

- (a) For convex f on convex set C, showed:  
  f(E[X], E[Y]) ‚â§ E[f(X,Y)]
- (b) Verified convexity condition via Hessian test:  
  f‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ ‚â• 0, f‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ ‚â• 0, and f‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅf‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ ‚â• f‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ¬≤

## Problem 5.9 ‚Äì H√∂lder‚Äôs Inequality via Jensen

- Recalled that H√∂lder‚Äôs inequality is:  
  E[X^{1/p} Y^{1/q}] ‚â§ E^{1/p}[X] ¬∑ E^{1/q}[Y], with 1/p + 1/q = 1  
- Derived this inequality from Jensen using (5.38) and convexity of exponential functions.

## Reflections

- Seeing Chebyshev, Cantelli, Jensen, and H√∂lder in one sequence highlights how convexity underpins most classical inequalities in probability.
- Understanding "sharpness" in inequalities is crucial ‚Äì not just proving them, but knowing when they are tight.
- Jensen‚Äôs inequality is extremely powerful; once convexity is recognized, many inequalities become straightforward.
