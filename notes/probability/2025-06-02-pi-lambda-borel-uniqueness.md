> Today's focus is on the π-λ theorem and its role in establishing uniqueness of measure, the construction of σ-fields from π-systems and λ-systems, and how this theory underlies the foundation of Lebesgue measure and Borel sets.

## Content logic

- Definitions of π-system (closed under finite intersections) and λ-system (closed under complement and countable disjoint unions).
- Lemma 6: any class that is both a π-system and a λ-system is a σ-field.
- Theorem 3.2 (π-λ theorem): if a λ-system contains a π-system, then it also contains the σ-field generated by it.
- Proof strategy: define auxiliary classes like 𝓛₀ and 𝓛_A to bridge from a π-system to a λ-system.
- Application: if two σ-finite measures agree on a π-system, then they agree on the σ-field generated by it — which guarantees uniqueness of extension.
- Set A_n: defined as the set of ω ∈ (0,1] such that d_i(ω) = d_{n+i}(ω) = d_{2n+i}(ω) for i = 1,…,n. This encodes digitwise periodicity with period n.
- Measure λ(A_n) = 2^n × 2^{-3n} = 2^{-2n}, by counting degrees of freedom in initial digits.
- Since A = ⋃ A_n, we get λ(A) ≤ ∑ λ(A_n) = 1/3.
- Borel σ-algebra 𝔅 is the σ-field generated from open intervals in (0,1], which includes all usual measurable sets constructed via countable operations.

## Key Ideas

- π-systems are structurally simple and usually serve as a “generating seed” for more complex σ-fields.
- λ-systems capture the idea of disjoint unions and complements, and when combined with a π-system, produce full σ-fields.
- The π-λ theorem is a central tool in measure theory — it’s what lets us say "this measure is unique" beyond simple sets like intervals.
- Uniqueness of the Lebesgue measure relies on this theorem: once the values on intervals are fixed, the measure on all Borel sets is fully determined.
- The set A_n captures digit-level periodicity and is a common structure in constructing rare or non-typical number sets.

## Proof Sketch

- Start with a π-system 𝒫 and assume it is contained in a λ-system 𝓛.
- Define 𝓛₀ as the smallest λ-system containing 𝒫, and show 𝓛₀ is itself a π-system by checking intersections.
- Introduce auxiliary classes 𝓛_A = { B : A ∩ B ∈ 𝓛₀ } and show they are λ-systems under the assumption A ∈ 𝒫.
- Use the structure of λ-systems and the closure properties to bootstrap 𝓛₀ into a σ-field.
- From the measure-theoretic side: for A_n, there are 2^n ways to freely choose the first n digits, and then the rest are determined by the repetition requirement.
- Thus λ(A_n) = 2^n × 2^{-3n} = 2^{-2n}, and λ(⋃ A_n) ≤ ∑ 2^{-2n} = 1/3 by subadditivity.

## Questions & Confusions

- Text refers to A_n as a set where “a segment is repeated twice,” but this is misleading. It’s actually “digitwise repetition” with step size n, not substring repetition.
- It’s easy to confuse repetition of digit patterns with structural repetition of blocks — but the definition works column-wise.
- When constructing σ-fields, why does closure under disjoint countable union + complement imply union/finite union closure? The trick is in decomposing general unions into disjoint pieces.

## Reflections

- Understanding the π-λ theorem clears up why measures can be trusted to behave consistently — it’s not just defined on intervals, it’s uniquely extended to the full Borel field.
- The logic of “generating systems + closure” is everywhere in probability — it appears again in defining expectations, distributions, measurable functions.
- Today’s material gives the logical foundation behind why "Lebesgue measure is the only one that assigns length to intervals in the standard way."
- Also a good reminder that Borel σ-fields go far beyond intervals — once σ-operations are applied, the structure becomes vast and rich.
