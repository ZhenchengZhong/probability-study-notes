## Key Ideas

- Any real number `ω ∈ [0,1]` can be written as a binary expansion:  
  `ω = d₁(ω)/2 + d₂(ω)/2² + d₃(ω)/2³ + ...`, where each `dₙ(ω)` is either 0 or 1.

- The sequence `(d₁(ω), d₂(ω), ...)` represents an infinite series of coin tosses.

- To ensure uniqueness of binary representation, we always use the nonterminating form (i.e., avoid representations ending in all 0s).

- A rank `n` dyadic interval has the form `(k/2ⁿ, (k+1)/2ⁿ]`.  
  All `ω` values that share the same first `n` binary digits lie in the same dyadic interval.  
  There are `2ⁿ` such intervals, each of length `1/2ⁿ`.

- The event that `d₁(ω) = u₁, ..., dₙ(ω) = uₙ` has probability `1/2ⁿ`.

- The event that the `(n+1)`th digit equals `u` has probability `1/2`.  
  This is because the set `{ω: dₙ₊₁(ω) = u}` is the union of `2ⁿ` disjoint intervals of length `1/2ⁿ⁺¹`.

- Binary sequences with `k` ones among the first `n` digits occur with probability:  
  `P(∑ dᵢ(ω) = k) = (n choose k) * 1/2ⁿ`  
  This corresponds to the binomial distribution from `n` fair coin tosses.

- Any specific infinite sequence (like `1,0,0,0,...`) has measure zero and can be safely excluded under the nonterminating expansion model.

## Reflections

The mapping from `[0,1]` to infinite binary sequences is not just a metaphor — it's a rigorous way to construct probability on an infinite process.  
Dyadic intervals and nonterminating binary expansions form the core of this model.  
What looks like "intuitive" coin tossing is actually grounded in measure theory via interval length.
