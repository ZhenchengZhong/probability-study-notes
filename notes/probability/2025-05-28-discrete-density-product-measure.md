## Content logic

### 2.18 – Discrete density and its closure properties

* Defined P\_n(A) as the proportion of A in {1, ..., n}, and D(A) as the limit of P\_n(A) as n → ∞.
* Studied the class 𝒟 of sets with defined density D(A), and proved:

  * 𝒟 contains ∅ and ℕ.
  * 𝒟 is closed under complements, proper differences, and **finite disjoint unions**, but not countable disjoint unions.
* Constructed periodic sets M\_a = {ka : k ≥ 1}, and showed D(M\_a) = 1/a.
* Showed that the field generated by periodic sets is contained in 𝒟.
* Proved translation invariance: if B = {m + 1 : m ∈ A}, then D(B) = D(A).
* Constructed a set A such that D(A) = x for any x ∈ \[0,1], by partitioning ℕ into dyadic intervals and selecting ⌊x·2^k⌋ elements per block.

---

## Key Ideas

* The definition of density D(A) depends on an infinite limit, but local structure (e.g., density within dyadic blocks) can be used to approximate it.
* If each dyadic block has density close to x and their lengths grow, the influence of earlier errors vanishes in the global limit.
* Translation invariance follows from the near equality between P\_n(B) and P\_{n-1}(A).

## 2.19 – Nonatomic measure spaces

* Defined a measure space as nonatomic if for any set A with P(A) > 0, one can find B ⊂ A with 0 < P(B) < P(A).
* Proved that Lebesgue measure is nonatomic.
* Showed in nonatomic spaces, for any ε > 0, there exists B ⊂ A with 0 < P(B) < ε.
* Constructed a sequence of approximating sets to find B ⊂ A with any desired measure x ∈ \[0, P(A)].
* Proved decomposition of A into disjoint subsets B\_i with P(B\_i) = p\_i · P(A), given any (p\_i) summing to 1.

## 2.20 – Countable additivity of product measure

* Constructed product measure P on the infinite product space S\_1 × S\_2 × ... using probabilities p\_{nu} on finite sets S\_n.

* Defined P on cylinder sets as P(C) = p\_{1u\_1}·...·p\_{nu\_n}.

* Proved that P is finitely additive.

* Applied Theorem 2.3 to show that P is countably additive on the algebra of cylinder sets, using the lemma:

  If A\_n ↓ A, and each A\_n is a nonempty cylinder, then A ≠ ∅.

* This lemma fails if any S\_n is infinite, due to “single-point fragility”: intersecting infinitely many slices that each pin down one coordinate can result in a singleton set which disappears when any coordinate set drops that value.

---

## Questions & Confusions

* (From 2.20) Why the lemma “intersection of nonempty cylinders is nonempty” fails when S\_n is infinite:
  Still unclear why removing one value from each S\_n immediately breaks the entire intersection.

* (From 2.20) Why the proof that “finite S\_n ensure nonempty intersection” works:
  Difficulty understanding how the diagonal sequence is guaranteed to exist without a formal constructive argument.

---

## Reflections

* Today’s study reinforced the central idea that density defined by natural number limits can be deeply linked to block constructions and modular structures.
* The transition from finite additivity to countable additivity hinges critically on structural lemmas that fail in subtle ways when infinite sets are introduced.
* Product measure theory is more fragile than it appears — small deviations in structure (e.g. infinite coordinate sets) can collapse key properties like countable additivity.
