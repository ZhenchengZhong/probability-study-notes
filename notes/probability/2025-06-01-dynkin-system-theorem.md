> **Note**:
> Today's focus is on understanding the proof structure of Theorem 3.2, which establishes that the smallest λ-system containing a π-system also contains the σ-field generated by it. The difficulty lies in managing the multiple interacting sets and set families involved in the argument.

## Content logic

* Theorem 3.2 (Dynkin System Theorem) states:
  If a λ-system 𝓛 contains a π-system ℘, then 𝓛 also contains σ(℘), the σ-field generated by ℘.

* The proof strategy is to construct a minimal λ-system 𝓛₀ that contains ℘ and show that 𝓛₀ is also a π-system. Then, since 𝓛₀ is a λ-system and a π-system, it must be a σ-field. By minimality, it equals σ(℘).

* The core idea is to fix an element A ∈ ℘ and define
  𝓛\_A := { B : A ∩ B ∈ 𝓛₀ },
  then show 𝓛\_A is a λ-system.

* If ℘ ⊂ 𝓛\_A, then for all A, B ∈ ℘, we have A ∩ B ∈ 𝓛₀, implying that 𝓛₀ is a π-system.

* Since 𝓛₀ is both a π-system and a λ-system, it is a σ-field containing ℘. Thus,
  σ(℘) ⊂ 𝓛₀ ⊂ 𝓛.

## Key Ideas

* The proof revolves around managing **seven different sets or families**:

  1. Ω: the universal set
  2. ℘: the given π-system
  3. σ(℘): the smallest σ-field generated by ℘
  4. 𝓛: the given λ-system
  5. 𝓛₀: the smallest λ-system containing ℘
  6. 𝓛\_A: sets B such that A ∩ B ∈ 𝓛₀ for fixed A ∈ ℘
  7. A, B: specific elements from ℘ or 𝓛₀ used in the argument

* The critical insight is that proving A ∈ ℘ and B ∈ ℘ ⇒ A ∩ B ∈ 𝓛₀ is sufficient to show 𝓛₀ is a π-system. Therefore, only cases where A ∈ ℘ need to be considered in defining 𝓛\_A.

* Verifying that 𝓛\_A is a λ-system requires:

  * (λ₁): Ω ∈ 𝓛\_A because A ∩ Ω = A ∈ 𝓛₀.
  * (λ₂'): if B₁ ⊂ B₂ and both in 𝓛\_A, then B₂ − B₁ ∈ 𝓛\_A.
  * (λ₃): if B\_n are disjoint in 𝓛\_A, then ⋃B\_n ∈ 𝓛\_A.

* The final step uses the minimality of 𝓛₀ to conclude 𝓛₀ ⊂ 𝓛\_A ⇒ A ∈ ℘ and B ∈ ℘ ⇒ A ∩ B ∈ 𝓛₀.

## Proof Sketch

* Construct 𝓛₀ = ⋂{ λ-systems containing ℘ }, guaranteed to be a λ-system.
* Fix A ∈ ℘ and define 𝓛\_A = { B : A ∩ B ∈ 𝓛₀ }.
* Show 𝓛\_A is a λ-system using properties of 𝓛₀ and basic set identities (e.g.,
  A ∩ (B₂ − B₁) = (A ∩ B₂) − (A ∩ B₁)).
* Show ℘ ⊂ 𝓛\_A using the fact that ℘ is a π-system.
* Apply minimality to get 𝓛₀ ⊂ 𝓛\_A ⇒ A ∩ B ∈ 𝓛₀ for all A, B ∈ ℘.
* Hence, 𝓛₀ is a π-system and also a λ-system ⇒ 𝓛₀ is a σ-field ⇒
  σ(℘) ⊂ 𝓛₀ ⊂ 𝓛.

## Questions & Confusions

* It was easy to get lost among the different layers: 𝓛₀, ℘, σ(℘), 𝓛\_A, and their element-level distinctions.
* Initially confusing: why we only fix A ∈ ℘ instead of allowing A ∈ 𝓛₀. Realization: it’s enough to prove π-closure inside ℘.
* Subtle point: 𝓛₀ is built from ℘, so while ℘ ⊂ 𝓛₀ is always true, the reverse is false. One must avoid circular reasoning here.

## Reflections

* The difficulty of Theorem 3.2 lies not in the technical steps but in managing abstraction: there are many layers of containment and logical dependency.
* The key to understanding was to map out all involved objects and their roles. Without this, it’s easy to confuse whether a set like B is in ℘, 𝓛₀, or 𝓛\_A.
* This result lays the groundwork for extending measures from π-systems to σ-fields, which is foundational to modern probability theory.
