# Probability Study Notes

This repository documents my study and interpretation of foundational probability theory, particularly the construction of a probability model on the unit interval and the motivation behind Borel’s Normal Number Theorem.

## Study Goal

This study is part of my preparation for applying to research-based programs in probability, statistics, or data science. I aim to build a solid foundation in measure-theoretic probability using classical sources such as Billingsley.
